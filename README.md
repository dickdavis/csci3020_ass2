#Assignment 2 - CSCI 3200 (APSU)
##About
This project is an assignment for CSCI 3200 (XML Processing) course at APSU. Being this is an educational project for a grade, collaboration isn't exactly the goal here. But if you feel that you can benefit from perusing my code, go for it! 

For reference, I have included the original assignment instructions. Additionally, I have included the sample CSV files and the resulting XML documents.

##What it Does
The purpose of the project is to extract specialized information CSV file and create a well-formed XML document based on the specifications of the project assignment. It works by reading and extracting information from the input file, storing that information in a couple structs, and then writing it to the output file. It allows the user to specify the input and output files, quits if the input file is not found, and ensures that the output file contains the `.xml` file extension. Read the included project assignment instructions for more details.

##Compiling
This project was compiled with the g++ compiler on an Arch linux machine. It *should* work with other Linux environments. Windows developers should be aware some changes to the program as well as system configuration may be necessary for it to function correctly on your system. 

To compile the project, use the following command:

`g++ main.cpp`

##Dependencies

This project does not use features outside of the STL, so no worries about dependencies here.

##Academic Honesty
Please, just keep in mind that academic dishonesty is probably (definitely) not tolerated by your educational institution, so come up with your own solutions. Besides, I sincerely doubt that your assignment has the same requirements as mine, so you will probably look like an idiot if you try to turn this in.

##Credits
I didn't find that I needed assistance on this project, and all of the code is mine.

##Questions/Comments/Concerns
If you have any questions regarding this project, send me a message and I'd be more than happy to explain my code.
